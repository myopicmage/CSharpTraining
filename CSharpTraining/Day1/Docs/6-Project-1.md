# Project 1

Less a project and more putting your knowledge to use!

1. Implement `FizzBuzzOne()`. Iterate from 1 to 100 and print according to the following rules:
    1. If the number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz"
    2. If the number is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz"
    3. If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
2. Implement `FizzBuzzTwo()` so that there's only one `Console.WriteLine()` in the function.
